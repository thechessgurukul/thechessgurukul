    <h1>The Boy Who Became India’s 92nd Grandmaster: A Story of Grit and Growth 🇮🇳🏆</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>In a world where many believe you need high-profile international coaching teams and massive residential academies to reach the top, one boy took a different path. While he eventually reached the global stage to secure his title, he didn't spend his formative years in a massive training facility. Instead, he trained with professional software, home-based analysis, and the unwavering support of his father.</p>
